## Project Specification
This is a group of 4 students and we're going to develop a fully-functionioning artefact using an agile-based approach and crucial such as
teamwork, decision making, time-management and effective communication & collaboration.
The artefact will be a web application for both mobile and desktop systems. 
The web application will be implemented using the following coding software/languages:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

This project not only provides us with a hands-on experience in developing a project that closely resembles a real-world application,
but it also exposes us to different challenges and scenarios that we may encounter whilst working as a team.
